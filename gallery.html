    <h3 class="works-title">Country Data Visualization</h3>
    <h4 class="works-info">Graphic Design 3, Fall 2024, Adobe Illustrator & Adobe InDesign
    </h4>
    <p class="works-description"> The Data Visualization Book is a collection of information that comes together in displaying the qualities that make up the unique country of Italy. The process began with intensive research in various categories like history, geography, and economy. I chose to use a vibrant color palatte to portray the countryâ€™s bold culture and traditions. The simple illustrations and decorative typeface come together in a visually appealing balance. </p>

    <h3 class="works-title">Cookbook Publication</h3>
    <h4 class="works-info">Typography, Fall 2024, Adobe Illustrator & Adobe InDesign
    </h4>
    <p class="works-description"> For our first typography project, we were tasked with creating a cookbook. From creating a grid, 
        developing a theme, and applying visual elements, the cookbook was a thourough project aimed 
        at enhancing skills in publication design. I challenged myself to illustrate each of the ingredients 
        and finished dishes to use as imagery throughout the book. In the end, I created a 54 page book 
        utilizing recipes from those who mean the most to me </p>

    <h3 class="works-title">Zine of Resistance</h3>
    <h4 class="works-info">Graphic Design 2, Spring 2024, Adobe InDesign, 11x17 inches
    </h4>
    <p class="works-description"> The Zine of Resistance is a continuation of the Icons of Resistance and serves as a call to action 
        against fast fashion. The zine allowed for further explanation of the icons in which we previously 
        created and more information on the harmful effects of fast fashion. When unfolded, the back 
        reveals a poster inspired by the tedious process of quilting. A quilt served as my inspiration due to 
        its direct juxtaposition the fast and cheap nature of fast fashion.</p>

    <h3 class="works-title">Family Grid</h3>
    <h4 class="works-info">Graphic Design 1, Fall 2023, Adobe InDesign, 10x10 inches
    </h4>
    <p class="works-description"> For the Family Grid, we were tasked with expressing the personalities of family or friends with 
        typographic compositions. We experimented with grid systems that were utilized throughout 
        the project and built unique compositions for each individual using content we developed. 
        We continued our journey with hierarchy and practiced basic typesetting to create a sense of 
        uniformity throughout the final piece. One of the most important things we focused on was 
        spacing and carefully choosing a typeface that prioritizes readability.

    <h3 class="works-title">Process Poster</h3>
    <h4 class="works-info">Graphic Design 3, Fall 2024, Adobe Illustrator & Procreate
    </h4>
    <p class="works-description"> For the Process Poster, we were asked to choose an item and conduct research into how it is made. I chose a golf tee due to its seemingly simple qualities. Throughout this process, I experimented with Mid-Century design styles which were brought in with the typography and illustration.
