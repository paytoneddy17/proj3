    <h1 class="about-me">about me!</h1>
    <p class="about-me-p">I am currently in my Junior year studying Graphic Design at Illinois  State University. Outside of academics, I serve as the Director of Public Relations & Marketing for my sorority, Delta Delta Delta, here on campus. Recently, I have been chosen to serve as the Vice President of Public Relations for the College Panhellenic Council here at ISU!
<br><br>
    I have been doing art for as long as I can remember, but it wasn’t until my junior year in high school that I fully dove into it. Through the support of my teachers, peers, and even the collegiate advisors, I landed on Graphic Design as my major. Now, three years into it, I could not imagine myself in a different field!</p>

    <h1 class="design-philosophy">design philosophy</h1>
    <p class="design-philosophy-p">When it comes to my experiences with design, I choose a more experimental approach. Not in the sense that my designs are unconventional and pushing the boundaries, but rather that my works each have a distinct identity. At this point in my career, I don’t believe I have a personal style, and I am okay with that. For me, I think it is valuable to have knowledge and experience with a wide variety of styles and concepts. This semester, I have made it a personal challenge to make each of my projects unique in style and design. I plan to continue this challenge as a way to expand my skills. </p>
